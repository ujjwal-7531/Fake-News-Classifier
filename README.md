## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Detects whether a given news article is **fake** or **real**
- 🔍 Uses NLP libraries like **NLTK** and **spaCy** for preprocessing
- 📊 Trained with **Logistic Regression** model
- 🧠 Achieves over **92% accuracy** on the test set

## 🧪 How It Works

1. **Text Preprocessing** using:
   - Tokenization (NLTK / spaCy)
   - Stopword Removal
   - Lemmatization

2. **Modeling**:
   - Logistic Regression using `scikit-learn`

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Accuracy
